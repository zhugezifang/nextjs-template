## 介绍

River City Ransom,known as Street Gangs in PAL regions, is an open world beat em up video game originally for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is an English localization of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari for the Famicom. The game was developed by Technōs Japan and released in Japan on April 25, 1989.

River City Ransom is the third game in Technos Kunio-kun series released for the NES, preceded by Renegade and Super Dodge Ball. Like its predecessors, the game underwent great changes in its storyline and visuals during localization to make it more palatable for Western markets. It was the first console game published by the developer North American subsidiary American Technos.

Remakes have been released for the X68000, PC-Engine Super CD-ROM², and Game Boy Advance. The NES version was re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007 and the Nintendo Wii U Virtual Console in October 2015. It was also released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in PAL Regions on July 25, 2013, on November 14 in North America. It was released again with the launch of Nintendo Switch Online on September 18, 2018.
