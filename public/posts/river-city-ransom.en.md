## Introduction

River City Ransom, also known as Street Gangs in PAL regions, is an open-world beat 'em up game originally developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It is the English adaptation of the Famicom title Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari, created by Technōs Japan. The game was first launched in Japan on April 25, 1989.  

As the third installment in Technōs Japan’s Kunio-kun series for the NES, River City Ransom followed Renegade and Super Dodge Ball. Similar to its predecessors, the game underwent significant modifications in both its storyline and visual design during localization to better suit Western audiences. Additionally, it was the first console game released by American Technos, the North American division of its developer.  

Over the years, multiple remakes of the game have been developed for platforms such as the X68000, PC-Engine Super CD-ROM², and Game Boy Advance. The NES version was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, followed by a Wii U Virtual Console release in October 2015. In PAL regions, the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console version became available on July 25, 2013, while North America received it on November 14 of the same year. Later, on September 18, 2018, the game was once again reintroduced with the launch of Nintendo Switch Online.
