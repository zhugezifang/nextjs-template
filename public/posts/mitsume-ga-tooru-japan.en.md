## Mitsume ga Tooru Nes

**Mitsume ga Tooru** (三つ目がとおる, *Mitsume ga tōru*, "The Three-Eyed One") is a Famicom video game developed by Natsume and published by Tomy. This game is adapted from the manga and anime of the same name, *The Three-Eyed One*. The story revolves around the protagonist, Hosuke Sharaku. Notably, a game with the same title was also released for the original MSX by Natsume two years prior to the Famicom version.

The player takes on the role of Hosuke Sharaku, the last descendant of the Three-Eyed Ones. The storyline begins with the introduction of another Three-Eyed One, Prince Godaru, who is seen piloting the ancient tank Gomorrah. Godaru wreaks havoc by destroying parts of the city and abducting Hosuke's friend, Wato Chiyoko. The game progresses as Sharaku ventures through five levels, each featuring distinct areas, in his quest to rescue Chiyoko and confront Godaru. These areas include a bustling city, a dense jungle, an ominous cave, a mysterious pyramid, a derelict ship, and a place ominously named Sodom.

The gameplay spans five distinct levels, each culminating in a boss battle. Players can move their character left, right, and jump, while wielding a weapon that fires bullets. Sharaku also has access to the Red Condor (*Akai Kondoru*), a spear that serves dual purposes: delivering double damage to enemies or acting as a temporary platform when jumped upon.

When enemies are defeated—either with the Red Condor or Sharaku's bullets—they drop gold coins. These coins can be spent in in-game shops to purchase bullets with varying speeds and damage levels, enhancing the player's abilities for future challenges.

**Level 1**  
Sharaku starts his mission by searching for Wato in the city streets. He rides atop a moving truck and battles in a stockyard. The level's final confrontation is against Goblin, a boss that can only be defeated when caught off-guard.  

**Level 2**  
This level takes place in a jungle and an expansive cave filled with dangerous creatures. The boss at the end of this level is a massive alien plant called Borubokka, which Sharaku must overcome to proceed.  

**Level 3**  
Sharaku ventures into an ancient pyramid filled with hazardous catacombs. He must navigate carefully to avoid spikes and other perilous traps lurking within.  

**Level 4**  
Hosuke sails on a motorboat to reach an abandoned ship. Inside, he battles through its eerie confines before confronting a spectral enemy—a giant ghost formed by swarms of malevolent fireflies.  

**Level 5**  
The final level, Sodom, is divided into three sections, each featuring a sub-boss. After overcoming these challenges and ascending an elevator to the surface, Sharaku faces Gomorrah. Following this climactic battle, he finally encounters Godaru, the prince of the Three-Eyed Ones, bringing the story to its conclusion.
