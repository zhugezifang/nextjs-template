## Bomberman Introduction

Bomberman (ボンバーマン, Bonbāman), briefly known as Dyna Blaster in Europe, is a long-standing video game franchise originally conceived by Shinichi Nakamoto and Shigeki Fujiwara. It was first developed by Hudson Soft and is now under the ownership of Konami. The first installment, also referred to as Bakudan Otoko (爆弾男, "Bomb Man"), debuted in Japan in July 1983. Since its inception, the franchise has expanded with numerous sequels and spin-offs across multiple gaming platforms, along with adaptations in anime and manga formats.  

By 2023, the Bomberman series had achieved approximately 16 million physical game sales worldwide, alongside 7.2 million paid mobile downloads, bringing the total number of units sold to 23.2 million.

## Bomberman Gameplay Online

The majority of Bomberman games are structured around two primary gameplay modes. In single-player campaigns, players must navigate levels by defeating enemies and reaching designated exits to advance. The multiplayer mode, a staple of the series, involves players competing against each other to be the last survivor. The gameplay centers on placing bombs strategically, which detonate in multiple directions after a set delay, allowing players to destroy obstacles and defeat opponents. Various power-ups enhance gameplay by increasing explosion range or enabling the placement of multiple bombs simultaneously. However, players must exercise caution, as contact with enemies or being caught in an explosion—including their own—results in elimination. While the core Bomberman games follow a maze-based structure, spin-off titles incorporate elements of adventure, puzzle-solving, platforming, and even kart racing.  

## Super Bomberman Introduction

Super Bomberman, an action-packed maze-based game, belongs to the Bomberman series and was introduced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1993. It was the first game in the franchise to retain the Bomberman title upon release in Europe, instead of being renamed Dyna Blaster or Eric and the Floaters.  

Following its success, Super Bomberman led to the creation of multiple sequels, including Super Bomberman 2, Super Bomberman 3, Super Bomberman 4, Super Bomberman 5, as well as later entries such as Super Bomberman R, Super Bomberman R Online, and Super Bomberman R 2.
