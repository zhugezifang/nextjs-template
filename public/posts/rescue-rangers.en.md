## Introduction

Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), inspired by Disney. Initially launched in Japan and North America in 1990, followed by a European release in 1991, the game also saw an arcade adaptation by Nintendo in the same year. Global sales reached around 1.2 million units, solidifying its status as a retro gaming classic.

Notably, each rodent hero can endure only three direct attacks before losing a life, and the game lacks password-based progression. In multiplayer mode, Player 1 controls Chip, while Player 2 commands Dale.
