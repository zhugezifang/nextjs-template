## Background and Features

**Name Origin**: The name *Green Beret* refers to the American Special Forces unit known for their green berets.

**Story Background**: Players take on the role of a special forces operative sent by the U.S. military on covert missions behind enemy lines, such as rescuing POWs. While the game does not explicitly name the enemy country, the level design and characters strongly reflect the style of a northern power, particularly in the weaponry used.

## Features:

**Melee Kills**: The game focuses on melee attacks, differing from other games of the time that centered on shooting mechanics.

**Jumping and Ladder Climbing**: Players need to jump and climb ladders, adding a layer of difficulty to the gameplay.

**Multiple Versions and Ports**: Originally released in arcades, the game was later ported to platforms like the NES. The arcade version features four levels, while the NES version includes an additional airport level (Level 2) and a base level (Level 6).

## Levels and Bosses

**Level Design**: The game features multiple levels, each with unique scenes and enemies. Notable levels include the airport (Level 2) and the base (Level 6), which are original to the NES version.

**Boss Fights**: The game includes distinct boss fights, such as the mini helicopter boss in Level 4. This helicopter is modeled after the real-life Ka-56 helicopter.

**Hidden Content**: The Japanese disk version includes hidden content like underground tunnels, and secret levels with cheat codes for selecting stages and gaining 10 lives. However, these features are absent in the American version.
