## Introduction

Plants vs. Zombies is a video game franchise developed by PopCap Games, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts (EA). The series follows the affiliates of David "Crazy Dave" Blazing as they use his plants to defend against a zombie invasion, led by Dr. Edgar George Zomboss. The first game, Plants vs. Zombies (2009), was developed and released by PopCap before its acquisition by EA. After PopCap Games's acquisition, EA expanded the game into a franchise with games on many different platforms, including a comic book series written by Paul Tobin and published by Dark Horse Comics.

The series has a variety of game genres. The original game and its sequels Plants vs. Zombies Adventures, Plants vs. Zombies 2, and Plants vs. Zombies 3 are tower defense games where the player has to use plants with different abilities to defend against a zombie invasion. The spin-off Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare and its sequels are third-person shooters where the player can play as either the plants or zombies in multiplayer (and beginning in Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, single player) matches. Plants vs. Zombies Heroes is a digital collectable card game with characters from previous installments.
