## Introduction

The Legend of Kage (影の伝説, Kage no Densetsu) is a classic arcade hack-and-slash title developed by Taito in 1985. Players take on the role of the ninja warrior Kage, navigating five action-packed stages to rescue Princess Kirihime from enemy forces. Each level is filled with adversaries, but Kage utilizes diverse combat techniques and weaponry to overcome obstacles and progress.

This arcade release became a commercial triumph for Taito, surpassing initial sales projections. Over the years, the game has been adapted for numerous home consoles, inspired sequels and spin-offs, and appeared in multiple Taito anthology collections.

## Paly Game

In the narrative, players embody Kage ("Shadow"), a young Iga ninja tasked with saving Princess Kiri (the Shogun's daughter) from the villainous warlord Yoshiro Kuyigusa and his ally, the rogue samurai Yukinosuke Riko. Armed with a kodachi blade and infinite shuriken, Kage battles through a dense forest, infiltrates hidden pathways, scales fortress walls, and storms a castle. Notably, rescuing the princess triggers seasonal shifts—from summer to autumn to winter—with an additional rescue required in the FC/NES edition.

Home console versions introduce a unique power-up system: collecting a crystal ball changes Kage's attire color, granting enhanced abilities like larger shuriken or increased speed. If damaged while wearing green or orange garb, Kage reverts to his default red outfit without losing a life. The game loops after completing five levels, continuing until all lives are depleted.
