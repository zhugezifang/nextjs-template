## Introduction 

The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, also known as simply Bugs Bunny, is a 1989 puzzle video game developed by Kemco for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. It is the first puzzle game in Kemco's Crazy Castle series.

Both the NES and Game Boy versions are Bugs Bunny reskins of Kemco's Roger Rabbit for the Family Computer Disk System and Mickey Mouse for the Game Boy. The Bugs Bunny version would be released in Japan in 1997 through Bugs Bunny Collection, a Game Boy compilation containing this game and its 1991 sequel The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2.

Each version of the game features different cartoon characters based on their respective titles: Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit, or Mickey Mouse. The object of the game is to go through a series of rooms collecting items to advance to higher levels while avoiding related cartoon characters.

# Game Play

While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differs from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny does not have the ability to jump; therefore, only by taking different routes can Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels have boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten thousand-pound weights that can be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game has a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove, and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects. Because most NES game cartridges lacked the ability to save, passwords can be used to start at a certain level in this game.
