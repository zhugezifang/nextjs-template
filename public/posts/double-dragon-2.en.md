## Double Dragon Introduction

Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game developed by Technōs Japan and originally released as an arcade game in 1988. This title serves as the first sequel to *Double Dragon*, which was launched the year before. In this sequel, players follow Billy and Jimmy Lee as they embark on a mission to avenge the death of Billy’s girlfriend, Marian. She is murdered by Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, who seeks revenge on the Lee brothers for his defeat in the previous game. Initially developed as an upgrade kit for the original *Double Dragon*, *Double Dragon II* grew into a fully-fledged standalone game due to a significant increase in memory size. As a result, developers reused several assets from the first game.

The arcade version of *Double Dragon II: The Revenge* kicks off with Marian's tragic death, once again at the hands of the Black Warriors’ leader. In response, players take on the roles of Billy and Jimmy Lee, who must now avenge her death. Compared to its predecessor, the arcade version of this sequel boasts several improvements. Notably, the game's controls were redesigned, replacing the original punch and kick buttons with two directional-based attack buttons (Left Attack and Right Attack), much like the controls in *Renegade*. Pressing the attack button in the player's current direction will trigger a series of punches, while pressing the opposite button will perform a back kick. Additionally, a few new moves are introduced, including the powerful Hurricane Kick.

Like the first *Double Dragon*, the game is structured around four distinct areas or "missions": a heliport, a lumber warehouse, a farm, and the gang’s new hideout. At the end of each mission, players must defeat a boss, with one or more sub-bosses scattered throughout each stage. Many of the enemy characters from the original game make a return, albeit with new appearances, enhanced attacks, and different weaponry. Some of the weapons wielded by enemies include knives, shovels, chain whips, and grenades. Moreover, players can pick up and throw various objects such as crates, logs, and steel balls. The key enemies in the game are as follows:

- **Williams**: A low-ranking gang member who uses knives and shovels.
- **Roper**: Another low-ranking member who also wields knives and shovels, as well as the ability to throw crates, logs, and steel balls.
- **Linda**: The only female member of the gang, she fights with whips, knives, and grenades. She is unique in that she is the only enemy who will carry a whip.
- **Oharra**: A re-skinned version of Abobo from the first game; he is tall, bare-chested, and sports a crew cut.
- **Burnov**: A large man in a steel mask who serves as the first mission’s boss. Upon his defeat, his body vanishes, leaving only his clothes behind. Later in the game, he gains the ability to rematerialize and continue fighting.
- **Bolo**: A re-skinned version of Oharra with longer hair.
- **Abore**: The boss of Mission 2, a large, blonde man in a white shirt, red pants, and sunglasses.
- **Jeff**: A palette-swap of Billy and Jimmy, who can perform all of their moves.
- **Chin Taimei**: The boss of Mission 3, an agile martial artist who fights with kali sticks, which he never drops, even when knocked down.
- **Willy**: The leader of the Black Warriors, who uses a machine gun and never drops it, even after being knocked down.
- **Doppelganger**: A shadowy clone of either Billy or Jimmy, whom the player must fight after defeating Willy in Mission 4. As the final boss, the Doppelganger is capable of performing all of the player's attacks and can drain their energy if they get too close. If two players reach the final stage together, they must each face their own clone.

Players have a life meter that depletes when they take damage, and a timer counts down during each mission. If either the life meter or the timer reaches zero, or if the player falls off the screen, into a pit, or onto spikes, they lose a life.
