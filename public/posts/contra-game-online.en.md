Playing Contra game online free is like taking a trip down memory lane. You can just open your browser, find a site, and within minutes, you're back in the action. And it's not just the NES version. You can find other Contra games too. Some of these online versions even have better graphics, so the game looks even cooler than it did back then.

The controls are easy to figure out. Usually, you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move and a key like the spacebar to shoot. It's simple enough for someone who's never played before, but it's still challenging enough to keep old - time players interested. And if you want, you can even play with a friend over the internet. Imagine teaming up with a buddy who lives far away and taking on those aliens together. It's a lot of fun.

## Contra Game Series: A Quick Rundown
The Contra game series has been around forever, it seems. It started way back in the 80s, and it was an absolute blast right from the start. The very first Contra game was a side - scrolling shooter. You got to be either Bill Rizer or Lance Bean. These two were like the ultimate badasses, on a mission to save Earth from a bunch of invading aliens.

What made the Contra series so awesome? Well, it was all about that fast - paced action. You'd be running, shooting, and dodging like there was no tomorrow. And those power - ups? Man, they were the best. The spread gun was like a golden ticket. It made you feel like you could take on the whole alien army by yourself. And playing with a friend in co - op mode? That was the best. You and your buddy would be shouting at the TV, trying to figure out how to get through the next level.

Over the years, the Contra series has changed a lot. New games came out on different consoles. Some added new characters, some had more complicated levels, and the graphics got better and better. But no matter what, that classic Contra gameplay was always there, making it a favorite for gamers everywhere.

## Contra NES: The One That Started It All
We can't talk about Contra without talking about the Contra NES version. This was the game that made Contra a household name. Back then, the NES was a big deal, and Contra was one of the best games on it.

The idea was simple: run, shoot, and don't get killed. The graphics were pretty good for the time. The enemies looked cool, the levels were well - made, and the boss battles were epic. And the music! Oh man, that Contra music was something else. It would get you all pumped up as soon as you heard it. You'd be like, "Okay, I'm ready to take on anything!"

Contra NES was tough, though. Enemies would come at you from all directions. One wrong move and it was game over. But when you finally beat a hard level or a boss, it felt like you'd just won the lottery. And then there was the Konami Code. If you knew it, you could get extra lives. It was like a secret weapon that made the game even more fun.

## Contra Games Tier List: Ranking the Best Ones
Let's talk about the Contra games tier list. Now, ranking these games can be a bit tricky because everyone has different opinions. But I'll give it a shot.

### S - Tier: The Absolute Best
- **Contra III: The Alien Wars (SNES)**: This game is like the king of the Contra series. It took everything that was great about the original and made it even better. The graphics were a huge step up from the NES. The characters and levels looked so much more detailed. The levels were also more complex. There were these cool vertical scrolling parts that made the game even more exciting. And the bosses? They were massive and really hard to beat, but it was so satisfying when you did. The music was just as awesome as ever, but with a more polished sound. It was like they took all the good stuff from the old games and made it perfect.
- **Contra: Hard Corps (Genesis)**: This one was a bit different from the usual Contra games, but in a really good way. It had new characters, and each one had their own special abilities. So, you could play the game in different ways depending on who you chose. The gameplay was still fast and full of action, but the new characters added a whole new level of depth. The levels were well - designed, and the difficulty was just right. It wasn't too easy, but it wasn't so hard that you'd want to throw your controller.

### A - Tier: Really Great Games
- **Super C (NES)**: As a sequel to the original NES Contra, Super C didn't disappoint. It had new levels, new enemies, and new power - ups. The game still had that same high - energy action that we all loved. The graphics didn't change a whole lot, but that didn't matter. It was still a lot of fun to play. It was like an upgrade to the original, with more stuff to keep you entertained.
- **Contra 4 (DS)**: This one came out on the Nintendo DS, and it was a great addition to the series. It combined the old - school Contra gameplay with some new features that took advantage of the DS's dual - screen. The levels were challenging, and the graphics were pretty good for a DS game. The music was also a nice throwback to the classic Contra tunes. It was a great way to play Contra on the go.

### B - Tier: Good, but Could Be Better
- **Contra: Shattered Soldier (PS2)**: This game had some good ideas, but it didn't quite hit the mark. The graphics were okay for a PS2 game, but the gameplay felt a bit off in some parts. The levels were a bit of a mixed bag. Some were really fun, but others were kind of boring. It still had that Contra feel, but it just didn't come together as well as some of the other games in the series.
- **Contra Returns (Mobile)**: This was a mobile version of Contra. The graphics were decent, and the controls were okay, but it had some problems. There were these in - app purchases that could give some players an unfair advantage. And not having a proper co - op mode on mobile was a bummer. It was a good try, but it didn't live up to the full Contra experience.

### C - Tier: Not So Great
- **Contra: Legacy of War (PS1)**: This game was a bit of a letdown. The graphics were old - fashioned, even for a PS1 game. The gameplay felt unfinished. The levels were repetitive, and the difficulty was all over the place. It just didn't capture that Contra magic that we all know and love. It's one of the weaker games in the series, for sure.
