## Introduction

Lode Runner is a 2D puzzle-platformer game that was created by Doug Smith and released by Broderbund in 1983. Its gameplay is reminiscent of the 1980 title Space Panic. In the game, players control a character tasked with collecting all the gold pieces scattered throughout each level, all while evading several enemies chasing after them. Lode Runner is notable for being one of the first games to offer a level editor, allowing players to create and share their own levels.

Following the release of the original game, numerous remakes, sequels, and spin-offs of Lode Runner have been developed and released for various platforms by different companies. Tozai Games currently holds the copyright and trademark rights for the series.

In the game, players guide a stick figure character who must gather all the gold in a level while avoiding capture by patrolling guards. Once all the gold has been collected, the player must ascend to the top of the screen in order to proceed to the next level. The game contains 150 progressively challenging levels that test both the player’s problem-solving skills and quick reflexes.
