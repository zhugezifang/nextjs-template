## Battle City Classic Game: Features and Gameplay

Battle City Classic Game is renowned for its simple yet addictive gameplay. Players control a tank tasked with destroying enemy tanks while defending their base, represented by a bird, eagle, or phoenix. The game features 35 stages, each 13x13 units in size, filled with various obstacles like destructible brick walls, indestructible steel walls (unless power-ups are collected), camouflaging bushes, slippery ice fields, and impassable pools of water.

Power-ups play a crucial role in enhancing the player's tank capabilities, such as increasing shot speed, allowing multiple shots, and enabling the destruction of steel walls. Other power-ups include a bomb that destroys all visible enemy tanks, a clock that freezes enemies, a shovel that adds temporary protective walls around the base, and a shield that grants invulnerability.

A standout feature of Battle City is its two-player cooperative mode, where both players defend the base together, despite the potential for friendly fire, which temporarily immobilizes the tank hit. Additionally, it was among the first NES games to include an edit mode for creating custom levels, although it did not allow saving these levels, unlike some later games.
